## Project Name: Thoth
Phase6ReadMe includes the app walkthrough in screenshots. 

## Topic Area: 
Healthcare

## Clients: 
Hospitals, clinics, drug distributors, patients, equipment companies.

## Decentralized issues/Background: 
Some of the surgical equipment is loaned between Hospitals by the manufacture. Sometimes the equipment may arrive a few days early, or on the day of a surgery. All the equipment also doesn’t arrive at the same time. For patients, they have to deal with filling out medical history whenever they go to a different healthcare provider. Sometimes different Hospitals may not accept a certain insurance company or it’s not always clear what’s covered by the insurance.

## Potential Problems: 
Surgeries could be delayed if the loaned equipment doesn’t arrive in time or it may be damaged. For the staff, they don’t know where exactly it is during transit or when it will arrive. Patients could be stuck waiting for their insurance company to approve a medical examination needed to determine what surgery they need. This could take days or weeks for the information to be confirmed and reach all the parties involved.

## How does blockchain help: 
The ledger can keep track of who has the loaned equipment and where they are or when they are shipped. Patients can have their medical history recorded in the blockchain which can be accessed by approved Doctors across different Hospitals verified by the Dapp. The shared information would also be updated for everyone. So instead of information going from insurance company to patient to doctor, the patient can let their doctor verify the insurance information directly from the company. Basically, everyone is sharing records and equipment and the blockchain records the transactions for accountability and improves the efficiency by sharing the information in a secure and trusted way.
